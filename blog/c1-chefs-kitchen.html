      Watching the <a href="https://vimeo.com/85001014" style="text-decoration:none;">video</a> by Shereef, and listening to him answer some questions was very helpful. Some of the questions asked were things I was thinking about and Shereef had good response to a lot of them. One that stuck out to me was the question about emphasis on pair programming. I have never done pair programming and it's a pretty new concept to me. Most of the time when I do my work, I like to do it on my own. But when Shereef answered the question related to that, he made an analogy between software development and soccer(the real football). I play soccer, and I was able to relate because I've experienced the difference between playing on a team where everyone is willing to cooperate, and playing on a team with individually skilled players but not so much teamwork. During my devbootcamp experience, I am willing to move out of my comfort zone and engage in the pair programming(not like I have a choice, right?).

      Also, I like the fact that Shereef mentioned that the aim is not to teach a specific tool, but rather the focus is on learning important engineering principles. I like the approach that DBC is taking. I agree with that idea because things are very dynamic but the underlying principles are usually still constant.
      By the end of the program, I want to look back and say, "I regret nothing". So I am going to take Shereef's advice and try to bring along a kitchen mindset to the program in order to have a good experience for myself, and also provide a good experince for others if possible.
