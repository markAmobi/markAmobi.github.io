  <h1 > To Understand Recursion, You Must First Understand Recursion.  </h1>

  <h4>May 27, 2015. </h4>

  <p>
    Recursion is a programming technique whereby a method calls itself. It turns out that this is a very useful technique even though it may seem counter-intuitive at first. How can a method call itself? Does this mean that the call to itself also calls it self? And so on...
    This is exactly correct.
  </p>

  <p>
    To understand the concept better, let's look at a basic example. (NOTE: The function/method syntax will be in Ruby, but this concept applies to other programming language.) <br>
    Suppose you were given the task to find the sum of all the numbers from 1 to 1000. How would you do this? <br>
    If you're familiar with Ruby, you know that you can take advantage of Ruby's simplicity and simply use this:
   <pre> <code>
      (1..1000).reduce(:+)
    </code></pre>
    <br>That's exactly what's I would do. But what if you weren't exposed to Ruby's beautiful simplicity? Assume you don't know much of the built-in functions in Ruby. <br>
    There are 2 ways to think about this problem. Firstly, we can think of it by starting from the beginning and keeping a running sum. A method to do this would look like:
    <pre><code>
      def sum_up_to(n)
        sum = 0
        (1..n).each{|num| sum += num}
        return sum
      end
    </code></pre>

  </p>

  <p>
    This basically says to start with a sum of 0, and then for each number from 1 to n, add the number to the sum. <code>sum</code> is like an accumulator. I think the idea above is probably how most people would approach the problem. By building up to the answer. <br><br>
    Another approach to this problem would be to think recursively. By creating a method that depends on itself. Using the fact that we know how to add 2 numbers, we can think of the problem as follows: If I can add up all the numbers from 1 to 999, the I should be able to add up all the numbers from 1 to 1000 by simply adding 1000 to that sum. This would look something like: <br> sum_up_to(999) + 1000<br>
    But we still have the same problem. You have to add up all the numbers from 1 to 999. Well, If you can add up the numbers from 1 to 998, the this should be doable as well. An so on... This is where the power of recursion manifests. The recursive method to do this can be written as:
    <pre><code>
      def sum_up_to(n)
        n==1 ? 1: (sum_up_to(n-1) + n)
      end
    </code></pre>

    The method says that to sum up to n, we check to see if n = 1. If n = 1, then the sum is 1. Otherwise, to sum from 1 to n, we can first find the sum from 1 to n-1 and then add n to it.
    Let us look at some more detail of what is happening internally. Say we called this function with an argument of 5 like this: sum_up_to(5). This is what happens.
    <pre><code>
      sum_up_to(5) = sum_up_to(4) + 5
                   = sum_up_to(3) + 4 + 5
                   = sum_up_to(2) + 3 + 4 + 5
                   = sum_up_to(1) + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
                   = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
                   = 15
    </code></pre>
    At each step, the argument to the function <code> sum_up_to</code> decreases by 1 until the argument becomes 1.
    <!-- You might be wondering how the expression <code> sum_up_to(n-1) </code> works. The computer handles this internally and does all the hardwork.

  </p>

      <h4> Conclusion</h4>
      Recursion is a very interesting programming concept. If you can break down a problem into smaller instances of the same problem, then the problem could be a good candidate for recursion. If you can get the logic of a problem to be recursive, you can write the recursive method and trust the computer to do all the hard internal work(assuming your logic is correct).
