  <h3>Pairing</h3>
  <p>
    From the beginning of Devbootcamp program, I've always been skeptical of doing pairing sessions. The main reason for this is because I haven't really been exposed to pair programming in my previous experiences. Also, I've always preferred to work on my own. So when I read the phase 0 handbook and saw that there would be a lot of pairing involved, I became a bit concerned. I thought that style would definitely not work for me, but I decided to give it a shot.
  </p>

  <p>
    My first pairing challenge went well. It was actually better than I had anticipated so it was a good first impression for me about pairing challenges. As a result of that I became more comfortable with the idea of pairing to accomplish a task. Pairing with another individual is very different from working on your own. People are different, and have different ideas. So pairing gives you an opportunity to see other ideas. During one of my pairing challenges, I had this idea to accomplish a certain task, but I thought it wasn't going to work out. But my partner was able to make it work. <br>
    Although I was initially skeptical about paring challenges, I appreciate the fact that Devbootcamp has made it an important part of the program because it definitely opens the mind to other ideas, and is very beneficial.
  </p>

    <h3> Feedback </h3>
  <p>
    Giving and receiving feedback after pairing is another thing I found to be a bit interesting about DBC's curriculum. After my pairing sessions I was actually very curious to know what kind of feedback I would receive. I think the idea of giving and receiving feedback is a vital part of development. Some of the feedback I received were helpful. In a couple of them, it was suggested that sometimes I don't make it clear what I'm doing. After thinking about that, I realized that it's kinda true. This is mostly because I'm used to working on my own. So sometimes, I overlook some minor details which might actually be important. But a successful pairing session needs open and transparent communication. I think it was really helpful to me that it was pointed out. This is definitely something I would try to work on.
  </p>

    <p>
      Writing feedback for someone else is quite challenging for me. Especially when it has to be anonymous and specific at the same time. I guess I'm still finding it a bit difficult to evaluate another person. So if you see a pretty vague feedback, it might be from me. I'm still working on being able to give Actionable, Specific and Kind feedback.
  </p>

    <p>
      Overall, I think that pairing and feedback is very vital in the learning process in whatever you do. By pairing, you're able to see things with 4 eyes instead of 2, and think with 2 brains instead of 1. You can learn a lot from your pairing partner if you create a good atmosphere with good communication. By giving and receiving feedback, you increase your self-awareness and you begin to start thinking about some things which you may have originally overlooked. With these, you can become a better version of yourself.
