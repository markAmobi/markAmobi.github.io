    <h3>Version Control</h3>
    <p>
      As the name implies, version control is simply a system of controlling versions of a file. It is simply a way to store memories of different changes to a file so that sometime in the future, these memories can be revisited(or maybe re-lived). For example, say you were writing a 10-page paper. It's possible that you might have different ideas along the way, and then you decide to save seperate copies of your paper so you can always go back and compare your ideas. This is a way of version controlling. This is an important idea because it helps to keep track of the past. The past is important. Several systems of version control have been developed to help make this task easier. <a href="http://git-scm.com/" style="text-decoration:none;"> Git</a> is a very popular one especially among developers. Git is basically an efficient version control system that helps you keep snapshots of different changes made to files in an organized way.

    <h3>Tracking changes in git</h3>
    <p>
        Git makes it easy to track changes you have made to a file by providing very easy to use commands. In order to track a file in git, you have to first bring git's attention to the file(initialization). After bringing the file to git's attention, you can go ahead and make whatever changes you feel like making(working stage). When you are done making changes, you then let git know that you are ready to save the current state of that file(staging). When you are sure that all is good, then you can "save" the file, which is called "committing" in git language. By committing a file, you save a snapshot of the current state of the file. Git provides several commands that you can use to view different snapshots of the file at anytime. Git is a very powerful tool to have once you understand how it works.

    <h3> Using GitHub</h3>
    <p>
        Github is essentially an online storage that can be used for git-tracked files. When using git on your computer, the saved files are stored locally on your computer. GitHub is essentially an alternative to storing the files on your computer. It is sort of like storing a file in Google Drive, or One Drive so that you have access to it from anywhere over the internet. Besides serving as an alternative storage, Github is a powerful tool which can be used for collaboration. When you store your code on Github, people with permission to access your code can view it and perform differents tasks with it. Github provides tools which makes it easy for people(with permission) to take your code, make changes without affecting your work, and those changes can later be merged to your original by you.

    <p>
      Whatever you do, wherever you are, whatever operating system you use, understanding version control will be very useful to you. Moreover, knowing how to use a powerful version control system like Git will be an invaluable skill to have.
