    Conflict, conflict, conflict... No one wants to deal with conflict. From my understanding, conflict is basically a situation that arises when some things do not go as planned or expected. I try to avoid conflict as much as possible, but the truth of the matter is that things will not always go as planned. I'll briefly talk about a situation that I faced a couple of months ago.
  </p>

  <p>
    Football(or soccer according to Americans) is my favorite sport. Occasionally I play for fun and it always gets exciting. I grew up playing soccer for fun and I've always loved it. Last semester in my school, there was a soccer intramural tournament and I had to join because every one was required to join. Just kidding. In case you missed where I already said it, I love to play soccer. So I decided to join.
  </p>

  <p>
    During the tournament, although my team wasn't really good, we won some and we lost some and we were able to make it to the semi-finals. We lost during the semi-finals, but that's okay. It's not that important. The most interesting game was during the quarter finals. The match started off pretty well and everything was going smoothly until someone from the opposing team screwed things up. To cut the long story short, the opposing team had a lot of nasty players and the referee wasn't really doing much to help out the nastiness. This was what brought about the conflict. About 10 seconds to the end of the game, I was about to score a goal and I got tackled pretty hard but the referee didn't call a foul. That got me pretty upset and I almost got into a fight with the other player.

      Thinking about what happened in the last 10 seconds of that game, I realized that the reason I got angry wasn't because the guy tackled me. During the game, there were several other bad tackles on my teammates and that also upset me. The referee didn't do a good job either. So when I got tackled, all those things combined brought about some negative emotions. After some more analysis, I realized that during the game, I felt like other team was pushing us around because most of my teammates were calm. I think this was the main reason I got upset at the end and almost got into a fight. Fortunately, with the help of other people around, things didn't get out of hand.

    I got home that day and thought about what had happened. I realized that things can't always go as you expect. I was also surprised that I lost my cool during that situation (Usually I don't). But sometimes, things get out of hand. It just depends on how you deal with the situation when this happens. After that I decided that when a similar situation occurs, I should be aware of myself and ensure that no negative emotions are leaking out. Positivity all the way!
