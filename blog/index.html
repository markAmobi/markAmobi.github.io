            <h3>VERSION CONTROL, GIT AND GITHUB</h3>
            <p>
              As the name implies, version control is simply a system of controlling versions of a file. It is simply a way to store memories of different changes to a file so that sometime in the future, these memories can be revisited(or maybe re-lived).

            <p>
              Watching the <a style="color:blue;"href="https://vimeo.com/85001014" style="text-decoration:none;">video</a> by Shereef, and listening to him answer some questions was very helpful. Some of the questions asked were things I was thinking about and Shereef had good response to a lot of them.

            <h3>CSS BOX MODEL</h3>
            <P>
              A lot of HTML objects can be thought of as boxes. whenever you create an HTML tag, you're essentially creating a box and trapping the item inside the box. Understanding the box model will help you a lot when you get frustrated trying to move your elements around.

            <h3>ARRAYS AND HASHES</h3>
            <p>
              An array can be thought of as a list of items. It is simply a collection of items. An array can be used to store different types of information in a certain order. For instance, say you wanted to keep a list of famous mathematicans. You can store this list in an array.

            <h3>MAP METHOD FOR ENUMERABLES</h3>
            <p>
              Ruby is all about simplicity. Ruby provides several methods to simplify things you might want to do while programming. One very import method is map method for Enumerables. Any descendant of enumerable class can have access to the map method.

            <h3>RUBY CLASSES</h3>
            <p>
              Object Oriented programming(OOP) is a very important programming paradigm. This type of programming involves grouping things with similar behavior together into what is know as a "Class". There are several programming languages which have OOP capabilities.

           <h3>PAIRING AND FEEDBACK</h3>
           <p>
            From the beginning of Devbootcamp program, I've always been skeptical of doing pairing sessions. The main reason for this is because I haven't really been exposed to pair programming in my previous experiences. Also, I've always preferred to work on my own.

           <h3>RUBY CLASSES VS MODULES</h3>
           <p>
            In a previous post, I talked a bit about Ruby Classes and how important Objected Oriented Programming is. I also mentioned that OOP is useful for grouping items with similar behavior together in one class. The importance of OOP cannot be overstated.

           <h3>Ruby vs JS</h3>
           <p>
             This week, we changed gears and started learning Javascript(JS). JS is the language of the web. It is built into all major web browsers and can be used to make websites interactive. In this post, I will be comparing of few features of Javascript with the Features in Ruby.
