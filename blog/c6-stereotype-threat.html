    In this post, I'm going to talk a bit about Stereotype threat. Before I proceed, I would like to thank DBC for exposing my ignorance by making me research on cultural topics like this which I'm usually ignorant about. Stereotype threat is one such topics. A lot of research has been carried out relating to this issue. According to Dr. Claude M. Steele, A social psychologist who has been doing research on the topic for over 20 years, Stereotype Threat is being in a situation or doing something for which a negative stereotype about one of your identities could be applied to you. Some of these identities are age, sex, race, religion, profession, ethnicity, nationality, etc.
  </p>

  <p>
    Steele's argument is that if you have to do things in certain situation because you have the identity, then the identity is likely to be part of you. Stereotype threat basically says that having negative idea about one of your identities can have a negative impact on your day to day life. Several experiments have been performed to support this claim. In one of the experiments, there was an IQ tests comparing Black individuals to white people. The result of the tests was that when the participants where told that it was just a puzzle, the Blacks performed significantly better than when they were told it was an IQ test. Steele suggests that by thinking of it as an IQ test, when the test got harder, frustration would probably cause the Blacks to think about how there's a stereotype that Whites perform better. This would result in a lower performance.
  </p>

  <p>
    I think one of the main reasons why an individual might experience stereotype threat would be self-awareness. I was born and raised in Lagos, Nigeria. Growing up in Nigeria, I wasn't really aware of some of the stereotypes between Blacks and Whites because I was always around people like me. As a result of this, the issue of stereotype threat in the context of race is very less likely to affect me than it would affect an African-American who grew up in the United States where there are several negative stereotypes about African-Americans. By doing a little research before this post, I became more aware of what people may have to deal with as a result of stereotype threat.
