    In this week's cultural blog post, we were asked to think about some values which we consider important to us and how affirmation can help lead to success. After looking at a list of different values, the ones which I consider important are accomplishment, achievement, ambition, personal development, challenge, having a family, knowledge, peace, and wisdom.
  </p>

  <p>
    All the values listed above are important to me. One which I think is very important is wisdom. In all aspects of my life, I'm always concerned about the making good choices. I believe that wisdom is the key to making good choices. With wisdom, you have good insight and you can think about things very well and make rational decisions. Without wisdom, I don't think some of these other values would make sense.

    <h3> Values and Stereotype threat </h3>
    In my last cultural blog post, I talked a bit about stereotype threat. According to some research carried out, one way to combat stereotype threat is through Affirmation. Affirmation is basically the assertion that something is true. In regards to stereotype threat, experiments have been conducted to support the claim that affirmation can be effective in combating stereotype threat. In order to do this, you need to recognize your self-worth and values that are important to you and be able to affirm them. With enough wisdom, you will be able to recognize when you feel a stereotype threat and remind yourself that your beyond that. Just think of those stereotypes as statistics. They're not always true. So just do you and don't pay attention to negative stereotypes.
